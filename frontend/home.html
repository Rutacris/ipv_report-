      <p>
        The most common question survivors get asked and the one behind which immense pain is hidden. Leaving an abusive relationship isn’t as simple as walking away. There are many things a victim has to consider before taking this step such as their children, finances, housing and more. Leaving an abusive relationship is the most dangerous time for a victim.
