          <h2>What is domestic violance</h2>
          <p>
            What is domestic violence?
            As the ongoing advertising says: “It’s not OK”. Your partner or any member of your family should never use violence to hurt or control you.
            Violence can be physical, sexual, psychological or financial and can include neglect. The Ministry of Social Development’s Family and Community Services.

           <p> Just as some of our young are vulnerable to abuse in the home, so are some of their grandparents.
             Age Concern says elder abuse occurs when a person aged 65 or more suffers harmful physical, psychological, sexual,
             material or social effects caused by the behavior of another person with whom they have a relationship implying trust. Elder abuse comes under four categories:<br>

•	Psychological – behavior that causes mental or emotional anguish or fear. <br>
•	Sexual – sexually abusive and exploitative actions entailing threats, force or the person’s inability to give consent. <br>
•	Financial – the illegal or improper exploitation and/or use of funds or other resources.</p>

           <h3>Not all domestic violence is physical</h3>
           <p>
            Not all family violence is physical. Psychological and emotional abuse doesn’t leave cuts and bruises and broken bones. But the unseen,
             emotional damage can be as great and the effects as long-lasting.
             Psychological abuse can be caused by repeated putdowns and name-calling, intimidation and harassment that make victims feel bad about themselves.
              It is likely to feature yelling and threats of physical
              assaults, threats to leave or threats of suicide. Looks,
              actions and expressions might be used to instill fear. Items valuable to the victim might be destroyed or their pets harmed.
               Psychological abuse can include mind-game manipulation and control of someone’s money, time, 
               vehicle or contact with friends as a way of asserting power over them. 
              The Family Violence Act 1995 made psychological abuse an offence. Providing victims with a means of protection, the Act 
              defines psychological abuse as “including intimidation, 
              harassment, damage to property, threats of physical, sexual or psychological abuse, (and in relation to a child), abuse causing
               or allowing the child to witness the physical, sexual or psychological abuse of a person with whom the child has a domestic relationship”.
           <h3> Family violence is not okay</h3> 
           <p> Violence in families is not okay, and it should never be ignored because “it’s just a domestic”. Statistics show family violence accounts for more than half of all violent crime reported in New Zealand.<br>
            It is often said that New Zealand’s most violent places are its homes. Like many “often-said”, it’s an exaggerated generalization.<br> New Zealand homes are mostly safe and peaceful. Some homes, however, are violent and abusive places, where physical, emotional and psychological wounds are inflicted on family members – 
            too often children. The numbers don’t make good reading. They reflect a sad situation for too many New Zealand families.
            Family violence affects everyone. Even if they’re not being physically abused, children are often victims, not only because of what they witness but also because they have to endure the consequences of dysfunctional and destroyed relationships.
            The Police and courts take family violence seriously. Police will act when they suspect or uncover incidences of family violence. </p><br>
            
            <p>New powers (see under Police Safety Orders) allow them to remove an offender, or even a suspected offender, to remove the immediate risk and to give everyone an opportunity to assess their situation.
             So a lot is happening in our community that the Police don’t know about. Whether we’re a victim, neighbor, part of the extended family, teacher, career or just a member of the community, we can help make it stop.
            Community and authorities tended to treat domestic violence differently from other forms of assault – what went on between a couple and their family in their home was considered their private business.  The now more commonly used term, “family violence”, describes violence in all its forms among family members. The term recognizes that violence affects the whole family, children in particular. Children are likely to be physically and emotionally abused in a home where there is violence already. Children who see and hear assaults on others in the home are likely to suffer emotional and other health problems.
            New Zealand studies indicate that in cases where women had been beaten, many of the children in the relationship had also been abused. </p><br>
            
            <p>Interviewing children, researchers found that almost all could give detailed accounts of violent behavior that their mother or father never realized they had witnessed. Battered women are more likely than other women to assault children. A United States study found that women who were chronically violent to their spouse were also likely to abuse a male child. The same study found that nearly all violent men assaulted their sons. (National Center for Health Statistics.) Family violence appears to be an established fact in our communities. Recent statistics show a rise in reported cases, but that might be a good sign – it is likely to indicate that people are coming forward more readily to report violence, rather than saying nothing and the case not showing up in statistics. If we all recognize there is a problem, we can do something about it.
            Why are some of our homes unsafe? And what can be done about it? Perhaps our starting-point should be to recognize that family violence is a crime. It is not a private matter that is no one else’s business. </p><br>

            <p>When they attend an incident, they also use an internationally recognized scoring tool to assess partner risk. They also have a Child Risk Factor Tool, which helps them predict the risks for children. Family violence is rarely a singular or random event. Where it is present, it punctuates the life of a relationship and it gets worse as time passes. Most reported family violence is committed by men against women and children, although women, like men, can assault children. A growing number of men say that female violence against them is not treated as seriously as male assaults on women. International research indicates only about 20% of family violence incidents are actually reported. So a lot is happening in our community that the Police don’t know about. Whether we’re a victim, neighbor, part of the extended family, teacher, career or just a member of the community, we can help make it stop.</p>
            
          </p>
          <h2>Reporting domestic violence</h2>
          <p>In a recent analysis of family violence statistics, for 21% of children’s cases and 35% of women’s cases, family and friends were aware of the violence but did not report it. In 64% of all cases the family had prior contact with the police.<br>
            The Police make every effort to protect people from family violence, but they need to know it’s happening. So why isn’t it reported?<br>
             In many cases, the victim is too scared to speak out, fearing more violence. But in most cases, someone else knows it’s happening and does nothing to stop it because they don’t want to get involved or they don’t want to be seen to be interfering.<br>
              The attitude that it’s a private matter that should stay in the family no longer washes. Recent high-profile cases have shown that children – and adults – have died because no-one reported the violence.</p><br>

              <h2>Protection and Police Safety Orders</h2>
              <p>The Family Violence Act 2018 marks a new era in dealing with family violence which came into effect on July 1 in 2019. It is the primary legal weapon for fighting family violence. It overhauled the Domestic Violence Act 1995 and  gives decision-makers in the family violence system better guidance about the nature and impact of family violence.  </p>
              <h3>Police Safety Order </h3>
              <p>Since June 2010, the Police have gained powers that have had a positive effect on dealing with family violence. A new Police Safety Order (PSO) gives Police the ability to make someone leave the premises for up to five days (usually one or two days) if the Police have reasonable grounds to believe that family violence has or may occur. They don’t need consent from the person at risk to issue the order.</p><br>
              <p>Public Safety Orders allow police to remove a person from a property where there is sufficient reason to believe a failure to do so may result in a serious incident, but not yet enough evidence to make an arrest.</p><br>
              <p>It protects members of the household who are at risk by imposing conditions on the threatening person similar to those in Protection Orders. These conditions apply for the duration of the PSO. For example, this person:</p>
              
              <p>•	Must not assault, threaten, intimidate or harass the protected person (the person at risk) or encourage anyone else to do the same.<br>
              •	Must not follow, stop or contact in any way the person at risk in any place, either at home, at work, or anywhere else the person at risk visits often.<br>
              •	Must surrender all firearms and their firearms license to the Police for the period of the PSO.
              •	</p><br>
              <p>The PSO also protects any children living with the person at risk, and any conditions of parenting orders or agreements giving access or care by the threatening person are suspended. The Police can detain this person for up to two hours to issue and serve the PSO. There is no right of appeal.</p><br>
              <p>If conditions are breached, the Police can take the person into custody and put them before the court.</p>
              <p>The court might:<br>
              •	Release them.<br>
              •	Direct the Police to issue another PSO.<br>
              •	Issue a Temporary Protection Order (if the person at risk does not object).</p>
              <p>It gives everyone an opportunity to calm down and meet with Police and other agencies to talk about improving their situation – and could save a person’s life. No criminal convictions result from the issue of a Police Safety Order.</p>
